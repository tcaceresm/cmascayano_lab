Score only of ligand pose sampled from molecular dynamics simulation.

Steps
	1) Protein-Ligand docking --> Protein-Ligand complex

	2) Molecular Dynamics of Protein-Ligand complex -->  Different conformations of Protein-Ligand complex

	3) Extract a snapshot or single conformation of PL-MD

	4) Docking score-only of that single ligand snapshot.
